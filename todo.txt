* Reading level inconsistent: main character is a bit cartoonish, others are outright stupid. Bottom line, if this is meant for adults to read, then you need to have adult characters. If this is for younger audiences, then you need to simplify your language.
* name him Lugen much earlier
* show-not-tell: You need to take the reader inside the mind of the DL If the hero does something that makes him wonder, let the reader infer this from his thoughts, e.g. instead of telling ".. this worries me.."
* Give Alice more backstory and highlight her relations with Lugen
* Rewrite the warband burst in scene. Make warband smarter
* Ecology thingy is way too modern science. The audience (warband) would not understand a thing.
