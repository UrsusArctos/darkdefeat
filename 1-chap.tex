\chapter{The Late Council}

\section{Expected Encounter}

I was sitting in my throne chamber in silence as heavy minutes flew by one by one. It was quite excruciating to force myself to do absolutely nothing but waiting, knowing that my master plan is reaching its pinnacle. But then, impatient people never become the Dark Overlords, do they?

I knew it would come to this. I wanted it to. I dreamed of it. I carefully crafted every bit of every circumstance I could think of to make it happen this way. When you are dealing with the prophecy, no detail is minute.

The last rays of sunlight swept across the chamber ceiling and dusk began to settle. The door lock clanked at the edge of perception and shadowy silhouette appeared in the frame.

\say{My Lord,} said silhouette, \say{the Hero has been spotted at the Blacksmith suburbs just ten minutes ago.}

I pondered the information for some time. Frankly, I quit feeling surprised by the tactical decisions of the Heroes long ago, before this particular one was even born. But still!

There were three general approaches to the Dark Citadel. One could land ashore by boat and climb the rocky cliff to reach the least guarded Oceanwatch tower. Being mostly equipped to deal with naval threats the vantage points allowing the personnel to look directly down were rare and usually understaffed. Tough, but not impossible, especially at nighttime.

One could also take Merchant pathway and blend with townsfolk to reach the marketplace inside Outer Court of the Citadel and its numerous warehouses and cellars. Hundreds of suppliers go there and back every business day. With a bit of luck the potential intruder could navigate vast underground tunnel system to reach Inner Court and from there -- my chambers. But that, of course, will only work during the day, and our Hero seems to have preference for more dramatic background lighting conditions.

Finally, one can enter the main eastward gates of the city and take all the way through Blacksmith’s, a drawbridge across the Fast River, past the Temple of All Gods, a Rosemeadow households, another drawbridge across the same Fast River, past the army barracks, and end up at the gates to the Outer Court. Which are closed for night. With manned guard posts at every bridge and sentinel monks patrolling between drawbridges in the Temple district.

Despite my best efforts I never stop wondering how Hero’s brain worked in a situations like this. You have been presented with three options – one to use the best of your physique, one to show your innate mastery of stealth and secrecy and another one is to completely depend on your sheer luck, unwarranted self-importance and overinflated charisma. Which ones do they chose? Go figure. Ah, and they call it “leadership”.

\say{Very good}, I replied. \say{Carry on.}

The silhouette vanished. Twenty more minutes flew by as I was seriously considering taking a short nap, but suddenly I felt the ground slightly shake and seconds after a distant rumble was clearly heard.

This was interesting. Either the attacking party had packed a bunch of explosives or they had a battle mage. If this noise was the breach of the front gates to the Outer Court, they were still too far away for me to feel the difference.

Some more minutes flew by. At the very edge of my perception I heard metal clanking noises and several loud cries of the battle.

I never underestimate my enemies no matter how stupid they are or try to appear. Too many Dark Overlords in the past fell victims to their own overconfidence. A little less many fell victims to their inability to comprehend that by virtue of unpredictability the ultimate stupidity is far more dangerous than an intelligence and knowledge put to a good use. Therefore you shall never constrain yourself in the expectations of the capabilities of your adversary.

Right\dots This all sounds very good in theory. But practice of half a dozen or less people storming the guarded Dark Citadel in head-on assault is entirely different. Deep in my mind the genuine worry started to creep. You can never be 100\% sure, it whispered. The absolute categories do not belong to this world.

Another explosion shook the grounds and a thunder-like sound followed shortly after. I felt the prickling sensation in the back of my head. Yes, this was a battle mage. And a powerful one, it seems. The honorable guests have just breached the gates to the Inner Court.

\say{Exmer,} I called.

\say{Yes, my Lord?} The dark silhouette almost like condensed from the thin air by the door.

\say{That would be all for now, Exmer. Take a vacation, give the boys some rest.}

\say{Yes, my Lord. Thank you.}

Now an interesting part. The Inner Court takes about two minutes to cross in the jogging pace from the gates to the entrance of the sanctum. It will take at least five more minutes to ascend ten floors to reach the upper halls. And anywhere from one to ten minutes to figure out in which hall the back door leads to the throne chamber. Unless the guests had an ingenious idea of splitting up or had somehow secured a map of the upper level, it will take them anywhere from eight to seventeen minutes until they find me. That will be the first factor for my threat analysis.

During that specific timeframe, no Citadel guard will attack them, or even be there, for that matter. To expect them to come to conclusion that I am not present in the chambers now is too far fetched, of course, but any at least slightly reasonable tactical-minded attacker would be immediately suspicious. And this will be the second factor of my threat analysis.

The chamber’s door burst open on tenth minute and a few people with lit torches poured in. Well, at least this part of a plan went without complications.

\section{Vindictive Warband}

Unlike most of the hallways the throne chamber’s windows were high and close to the ceiling. The throne was traditionally situated opposite the entrance at the elevated dais and located so that rising sun will illuminate the sitting monarch giving the environment a taste of royal divinity. At other times, the chambers was meant to be lit either by torches or daylight. Neither was the case now, and if you enter the throne chamber from the much darker hallways the only things you can see at first are the windows, especially now that evening dusk was not yet over. And everything else in the chamber was almost completely invisible especially if you hold a torch in your hand.

I quietly watched the party. The Hero was so archetypal it nearly made me smile. Moderately tall very muscular man in his mid-twenties with dark wavy hair descending on his shoulders, brown piercing eyes, extended jaw as though chiseled from stone, perfectly straight nose, head sitting on a neck just as thick, mandatory scar across the left cheek, arms with muscles as prominent he may just crush your skull easily if he wanted to and a ribcage so broad it make his torso appear triangular from that distance. The Hero wielded a two-handed sword and a torch.

Standing right next to him was much taller and skinnier man covered in leather armor and wearing fur hat, his branch-like limbs wielding a bow and arrow in a ready to shoot position. His eyes were nervously moving.

To the other side of the Hero stood a man in a simple gray tunic, leather belt with numerous pockets and wearing sandals. He was completely bald, his gaze was fixed dead straight on me and his wrists and palms were emitting barely visible reddish glow. The battle mage, as they are. My wild guess would be that this one was no less than a Cradle Priest.

Finally, behind the Hero stood yet another intruder not needing any introduction or analysis. My beloved Alice, my little girl, the warmth of my life, the only living being in this world in whom I truly found a genuine joy. My daughter.

Except the mage, none of them saw me behind the table. Either human eyes are so tricky when dealing with twilight or they were expecting to find me sitting on the throne.

\say{Damn,} sounded the Hero, \say{This is the throne chamber. Where else could he be?}

\say{Shhh,} hissed the mage and pointed his hand at my direction.

All right, let’s play.

\say{Welcome, good lady and honorable gentlemen.} I waved my hand and torches across the throne chamber flashed and ignited. \say{Please, have your seats. You must be tired after your long and eventful journey here.}

The archer jumped in surprise and aimed his bow at me. The battle mage clapped his hands and engulfed himself in a nearly invisible glow of the magic shield. The Hero jumped on a table and ran towards me screaming and waving his sword.

Threat analysis: low.

Five seconds later the Hero was carefully touching the back of his head after it collided with a nearby wall with rather unexpected velocity. His sword cracked and broken in three pieces laid nearby on the floor. The archer was sitting on the floor stupidly looking at the snapped bowstring and an arrow split in two and visibly charred. The battle mage was nervously alternating his gaze between me and the entrance door right after it slammed shut in front of him apparently trying to run away. Alice was kneeling by the Hero, asking if he was hurt, hugging him and murmuring something caring and encouraging.

I cleared throat.

\say{All right, let us try this again. However, before we proceed, let it be known that I am genuinely offended by your disrespectful behavior and threatening attitude. With the exception of this good lady here, I have never seen any one of you in my life and, to my best knowledge, I have never done any of you or those dear to you any harm that would warrant your warband to burst into my home in such an unpleasant manner, let alone with the apparently homicidal intent.}

The party listened gloomily and quietly.

\say{So, please, take your seats and we will try to resolve our enmities in a civilized manner, shall we?}

The quartet cautiously sat at the far side of a table.

\say{As a good-mannered host I would have offered you a drink, but something tells me that your level of distrust at this moment might render this gesture unappreciated and useless. So, down to business. Who is in charge of your party?}

The Hero opened his mouth and took a breath but Alice suddenly interrupted

\say{You cannot pretend I am not existing! You can not pretend you do not notice me!}

The Hero turned to her and put his hand over hers, nodding reassuringly.

\say{Other than these two statements are mutually contradictory,} I replied, \say{I can assure you that I, on the contrary, fully ascertain your existence and, moreover, I do notice you. That I do not react to these two aforementioned facts in the manner you rather expecting, is not my fault, per se.}

Crooked grin appeared on Alice face and she opened her mouth to say something even more insulting but this time Hero just squeezed her hands in his firmly and she went quiet.

\say{My name is Ferin,} the Hero begun, \say{I come from the seafaring tribes of the Nation of Ezeek. Ezeek was once a rich, prosperous and glorious land and people of its tribes are widely known for hospitality and generosity as well as bravery of its fearless warriors. Our history goes and is remembered as many generations back, our legends and tales are retold worldwide. Ezeek tribesmen are respected across the continent and beyond the seas and ocean.}

Aww, yeah. The good old nationalist resentment. You have never failed me.

\say{All of this is now history,} Ferin continued. \say{The Great Winter War devastated and depleted our lands, divided our tribes, turned brother against brother and son against father. Almost one third of our fertile lands have been taken from us. We no longer command respect, we are being laughed and spat upon. Our nation is declining, less and less people want to take Ezeek women as wives, and many youth are fleeing the land never to return, our children no longer remember their true ancestry, our elders die alone in neglect.}

\say{I have got the overall picture, Ferin,} I mused. \say{Make your point.}

\say{I am the youngest son of Prince Enceris. I am the only surviving member of the Prince’s family. My father died fighting Dark Legions at the outskirts of Kalpan before they razed the city to the ground, killing my mother and sisters. My two brothers died trying to break siege of Inilpan laid by Dark Legions month later. By then, families of other Princes were already extinct, murdered by the Legions.}

His voice raised as he continued almost screaming

\say{As I am the only remaining legitimate heir to the Sceptre of Ezeek, it is my sacred duty to restore greatness of our nation! Or die trying, like my ancestors, in glorious battle! In the name of All Gods and by the sacred power bestowed on me by people of Ezeek, I judge you fully responsible for the atrocities committed by the Dark Legions under your command against my nation and I sentence you to death!}

Ferin took a breath. I considered the accusations. The boy seems to have pretty solid ground, provided he wasn’t lying about his royal ancestry or took it for granted without much substantiation. Now I must carefully lead him through certain inconsistencies in his worldview, before he will be ready to swallow the bait.

\say{Speaking of judgment and sentences, my dear Ferin, don’t you think I deserve some degree of due process and fair trial? Like being able to defend myself, at the very least. Because your side of a story, no matter how true, is told from the perspective of an interested, hence biased, party.}

\say{No court in the right mind will ever consider\dots}

\say{And we do not need a court. If I am not mistaken, we have a Cradle Priest here.}

Battle mage startled and looked at me in a mix of horror and disbelief. I bet he regretted joining these adventurers at least thousand times. Or, perhaps, he alone of them all understood pretty well that I can just kill them all at once faster than they could blink. And the fact that I do not do so and not live up to my reputation in this particular case, made him even more nervous.

\say{But how are you supposed to \dots ?} Ferin inquired.

\say{Priest, I demand the invocation of the Judgment of All Gods.}

I looked aside and a chalice and a knife floated from the shelf to the table.

\say{By the blood I submit\dots Be my witness.} I cut my palm and a few droplets fell into the chalice. \say{By the blood I submit\dots Be my advocate.} A few more droplets. \say{By the blood I submit\dots Be my adjudicator}.

I levitated the chalice to the other side of the table and the quartet looked at it with rather dumb facial expressions.

\say{I do not understand.} The archer spoke for the very first time. \say{What is the point of all this show and theatrics? You kind of like to play cat and mouse with us here? It’s not like you are bound by any “judgments” of this sort, aren’t you? What’s there to prevent you from just killing us all should his “Gods” somehow reach a conclusion you happen to not like?}

\say{Nothing,} I noticed. \say{But if I wanted you dead, you would have been dead long before you even reached the Citadel. The guards spotted you right on the city-line.} They looked at each other, visibly surprised, but did not comment.
\say{Therefore, one could surmise, your death is not among my immediate priorities. Alas, this is the fundamental failure I so often observe among so many young people nowadays -- namely, the path from point A to point B lies between these points. And if I set out from A towards B isn't it very likely that B is my destination?}

The quartet looked even more puzzled than before. I mentally caught myself prone to "villain monologuing" and had to stop myself.

\say{Never mind. Let's just do this: I give you my word. I very well understand what reputation I have in your eyes -- that of a ruthless and barbaric tyrant, and it may be true, but a liar I am not.}

Still none of them moved or said a word. They knew and felt that something was very wrong, and the very awkwardness of the situation completely ruined their mental models of me in their heads.

\say{All right, let us assume that your meaningful silence indicates some sort of preliminary agreement to the overall procedure. I am sure the Priest will provide necessary details later as well as observe and maintain a degree of fairness in this particular confrontation. May I begin my defense?}

Priest startled again and moved his gaze from the chalice to his hands. He was, almost literally, the embodiment of "being uncomfortable" concept.

\say{Dear Ferin,} I started, \say{you claim to be the only legitimate remaining heir to the Sceptre of Ezeek. Are you sure this is true? Because last time I checked the political landscape of the Nation of Ezeek, there were five to six different, respected and ancient dynasties in the power struggle for the Sceptre, and, to the best of my recollection, the descendants of the poor Enceris were not even considered as entries to the contest.

Moreover, for a supposedly true legitimate heir to abandon his loyal subjects and embark in a dangerous and lenghty adventure like this and not take at least a company of, say, royal guard or something like that? So much for the bravery of fearless warriors\dots I bet none of your present companions are of Ezeek origins, aren't they?

My boy, your motives and intentions, without a doubt, are righteous and beyond reproach. You just kind of forgot to mention that Princes of Ezeek tribes are not entirely hereditary titles, but rather a periodically reelected positions. If a House of the Prince is wiped out, a new prince from a new dynasty of the same tribe is elected.

All things considered I must come to a conclusion somewhat unpleasant to you. That is, having realized that your survival in the Great Winter War alone does not warrant you even the restoration of your former princely privileges, let alone candidacy for the Sceptre, and that your tribe will surely elect another family for its Princedom representation, you decided to put the Heroic Feat at stake. The Ezeek general populace typicaly consider the political maneuvers of the competing dynasties too boring to follow or sympathize because they do not see the differences between them, if there are any. But the Heroic Feat is entirely different thing. Bring them the head of their mortal enemy, bring them \textit{freedom} from oppression and let them believe that this was the true source of their suffering and it is no more, and the common folk will unconditionally hand you the Sceptre overnight.

I must admit, this was brilliant plan. And it may have worked, If only you have given a thought of \textit{who} you will be trying to kill. Speaking of it, may I ask you what was the original intended outcome of your assault on my premises? I am under the impression that at least two of you wanted to kill me.}

\say{I said, I have sentenced you to death for your crimes,} muttered Ferin.

\say{But just a few moments ago you said, to quote, that your sacred duty is to restore greatness of your nation. May I ask you how my death would have served that purpose?}

\say{The Dark Legions have proven to be, and still constitute the major threat to the lands of Ezeek. This threat have to be eliminated in order to prevent anything like Great Winter War from happening ever again.}

\say{Yeah, that sounds reasonable, but my question still stands -- how exactly my death would have prevented the Dark Legions from waging war against the land of Ezeek?}

\say{Are you taking me for a fool? No army would launch a campaign like that all by itself without its supreme commander!}

He was angry, felt like being underestimated and morally justified. Perfect material.

\say{Quite the contrary, in fact. I am taking you for a future Prince of Ezeek tribe, and, who knows, perhaps the wielder of the Sceptre itself. Unfortunately, my boy, you are in obvious need for some unpleasant history lesson, which I shall deliver in a moment.}

I took a deep breath. I need to tread this one very carefully.

\say{As you yourself said earlier, the Ezeek tribesmen are known for their generosity and hospitality far beyond their native lands. One can only wonder why, to quote, bravery and fearlessness of its warriors are also known far beyond their native lands. I just happen to have a theory explaining that about two thirds of Ezeek territory lies in the rocky highlands and are unable to support steady subsistence farming, let alone sustainable cattle husbandry. Also, the Ezeek sea remains frozen well into late spring at these latitudes so navigation can not be opened until then. No trade destinations lie either to the north or west of major Ezeek ports. Combined with the fact that fish production volumes also suffer from the annual climate variations, it is quite expected that total food supply varies annually as well.

Let me put it in simpler terms. Every four to five years the ice layer covering the Shallow Strait between northern ocean and Ezeek sea grows so thick it remains unbroken well into mid-summer, and when it finally breaks, the sea and air temperature are already high enough that the icebergs melt completely long before they reach the latitudes of Kalpan valley. The high salinity in the upper sea layers thus prevents most species of fish from entering the major valley rivers upstream for spawning so they turn back and spawn in the rivers to the south of High Peaks. As a result -- no fish for poor Ezeek fishermen.

For the very same reason the northward warmwater circulation current does not restart at summer until, at least, Shallow Strait pack ice is broken and massive cold saltwater inflow from northern ocean displace the deep layers of the much warmer current at the southern Ezeek sea, pushing them closer to the surface. Until that happens, the temperature of the current does not rise, evaporation decreases and the eastward winds blowing from the sea over Kalpan valley and much of Ezeek inland territory do not carry enough moisture to precipitate. The germination of crops is delayed by at least two months and they can not ripe before northern winds start blowing over again. And even if the winds are seasonally delayed, the lack of moisture causes drought and you can not save your harvest by irrigation because that would entail the use of already seriously depleted Kalpan river system. What is worse in this situation is that even if salinity levels make Kalpan rivers accessible, You have to make a choice -- either let fish spawn in the valley in early spring and let your harvest die later or save the harvest but block the fish from spawning there when it had a chance.

Bear in mind, my dear boy, that this is very simplified explanation as we are still far away from knowing the works of nature in such a minute detail. Sometimes fish do manage to spawn in the Kalpan valley but the rains are still mostly absent, sometimes the opposite happens. It largely does not matter.

What matters is that every six to seven years the glorious and prosperous tribesmen of Ezeek find themselves quite hungry with no apparent means to alleviate the problem. You do not have trade routes across your land to tax them, no minerals, gems, gold, ores or timberwood to offer for a trade with your neighbors. What you do have, though, is a relatively large fleet of fishing boats easily convertible to pirate schooners able to reach south of the High Peaks in no time and quite considerable bunch of brave and fearless warriors eager to venture southeast where other people just happen to have more fertile lands, lesser dependennce on the whims of the nature, and being not so skilled in open combat and building strongholds.

This, my dear Ferin, is the true source of richness, prosperity and glory of the sacred land of seafaring tribes of Ezeek, blessed be their Princes. It had always been so and it is only natural that the basic survival did not interfere with any ethical qualms. Well, up until when the southeastern tribes just had enough of your piracy and raiding and had called for the Dark Legions to protect them from the likes of you.}

\say{What? This cannot be true! The Kings of upper Inilpan have suffered from the Great Winter War just as much as we did -- they could not possibly have \textit{invited} you to interfere on their behalf!}

I smiled.

\say{Of course they say they suffered just as much. And it is a mere coincidence that the total export volume downstream the Inilpan had steadily increased for five years straight now. All the while you went lurking aroung nursing your childish revenge plans.

By the way, I am not finished yet. That part was concerning the true nature of the "former glory" of Ezeek tribesmen. Let us turn our attention now at the Dark Legions.

You know, boy, I am once again find myself deeply offended by your assumptions. I do not like to surround myself with incompetent fools whose only merit is to merrily agree to whatever stupid idea I come up with. The Great Winter War lasted for two years, remember? Guess how many times I personally have been to the General Staff? Not once. I trust my generals because only the people I trust can be my generals. Even if your pathetic warband were to somehow kill or neutralize me, the Dark Legions would not automatically disband and run away in panic -- they are not mere slaves held together by forcible imposition of my evil will. They are professional, well trained, well supplied and well paid standing army. And there are contingency plans distributed among every top army officer and every important government official detailing actions and measures to be undertaken should I meet my downfall prematurely. Rest assured, none of said actions and measures are anywhere near what you expected them to be.}

Ferin looked completely stunned. I was beginning to worry that I am supplying the information he needed way too fast. We have got to take a break.

\say{Ferin!} I called. He looked straight at me. \say{The war ended five years ago. At any time I could have turned the whole Ezeek into a barren wasteland. But I did not. Do you now understand why?}

For the first time since the party bursted in, Ferin appeared in deep thought. His hands covered his face and his comrades were tactful enough not to bother him now. I almost felt pity of him -- the boy suddenly had too much information to process and acquire and, much worse, too much information previously held true to reconsider. But if he is truly a descendant of Ezeek Princes, he can manage it. Rulers in denial do not live long.

\section{Family Matters}

\say{Alice}, I whispered. \say{Would you mind a few words in a relative privacy?}

She stood and strolled along the table, taking the chair next to mine.

\say{Yes, daddy?}

\say{Stop that, please. Tell me, what exactly is happening here and now?}

\say{Hmm\dots To the best of my observational knowledge,} she started putting serious face, \say{it appears as if a vengeful, ambitious and morally justified hero supported by his faithful friend, wise mentor and and comic-relieving sidekick is leading an expedition to strike at and eradicate the evil Overlord and free his numerous oppressed subjects from said oppression\dots}

\say{Are you engaged?} I inquired. The fact that there were a Cradle Priest in their warband suddenly appeared to me from rather unexpected angle.

\say{That is none of your business!} hissed Alice, putting all of her willpower not to blush and failing at it miserably.

\say{Actually, it is. I am still your father, I do not recall us officially disowning each other and by the tradition of our people and by the Common Law you both have to ask for my blessing.}

\say{I do not need your blessing! I am an adult, I am not anyone's property and I have a free will of my own! And I can date, sleep with, engage and marry anyone I damn well please!} She looked at me as if I was about to take away her favorite toy.

\say{My dear girl, you have been absent from this home in general and from my company in particular for far too long. You seem to completely forget how things like that is dealt with here.}

Oh shit, that sounded so menacing and threatening. I did not intend for that.

\say{I mean, what makes you think that getting my blessing will be a big problem?}

\say{I do not care how big of a problem it will be, daddy. My life do not belong to you anymore.}

It is often said that females, unlike us all logical straightforward males, tend to think in emotions and communicate in hints and allusions rather than statements and facts. Damn you! Do I have to spill this out straight?

\say{That is correct. But your inheritance still does, though.}

Tick-tock, clank-clank. Oh, these precious moments of my life like watching my beloved daughter drop her jaw in the shock of sheer magnitude of what has just been said and heard.

\say{But do you\dots Am I\dots But how do we\dots} The rush of thoughts apparently far exceeded her capacity of speech at this moment. I waited patiently. \say{I honestly did not think of that.}

\say{I honestly do not believe you for a second, my dear girl. Am I to assume that either you did not know the heritage laws of our domain or that you volunteered to participate in the conspiracy of these wannabe assassins without ever giving slight thought of who is to sit on the throne next should your plan succeed? I tend to find both assumptions offending my intelligence. And yours, for that matter.}

\say{Wait! Stop! Let's get this straight. You are openly admitting my involvement in a conspiracy to depose or kill you and at the same time you are sitting here talking shit about my inheritance! How is that even possible?}

\say{Wrong question, my dear. You should actually be asking how is that impossible. On average, during the past hundred years alone, seven of every ten rulers on this continent died from conspiracy by close relatives. Of these seven just three died having been murdered by their siblings and remaining four were slain by their own offspring. I can see a pattern when there is one.}

\section{Court Adjourned}

Alice walked back. Ferin, finally having reached some decision, sighed heavily, stood and said

\say{I must admit that your clever words had sown some seeds of doubt in my mind. If what you said of Kings of Inilpan and other southeastern tribes is true, and I will take serious measures to know that for sure, then your intentions in the course of war stand at least some moral grounds. Your actions, however, did not! Parts of our land remains taken, the other parts devastated, our fleet diminished and there is not a single Ezeek family who have not lost a husband, a brother or a son in a Great Winter War. Their spilled blood still calls for justice! And the justice will be served.}

He took his dagger and cut his palm, clenching his fist above the chalice. I observed

\say{Before the justice is served, let it be known that while you wanted vengeance for the fallen, I had to correct nature's mistakes. These ends rarely meet, if ever. During the five years that had passed since the end of Great Winter War, the drought occured over lands of Ezeek twice and fish disappeared from the rivers of Kalpan one more time. And yet, despite the inability of Ezeek tribesmen to mount either pirate or overland raids as usual, the famine did not struck. Your national pride will not like this solution, of course, since you were raised in the paradigm of "I shall take what I deem is mine" and the idea of negotiations for humanitarian aid is some centuries ahead of your political culture. But so far no one had anything better, so we shall make do with what we have got.}

\say{By the blood I submit\dots Be my witness.} Ferin glanced at me, his facial expression completely unreadable. \say{By the blood I submit\dots Be my advocate.} Alice and archer looked at the chalice as if in trance. \say{By the blood I submit\dots Be my adjudicator}. The Cradle Priest took the chalice in his hands and closed his eyes, murmuring an incantation. Everyone waited silently.

This was the riskiest part of the plan, since I have no control whatsoever of the outcome of the Judgment of All Gods. The Judgment was the ancient magical ritual discovered by the early mages. Not only no one knew what kind of evidence and testimony the All Gods take into their consideration to produce a Judgment, but the very concept that this ritual even constitutes a Judgment based on the material presented by the parties -- remained largely open question. It might as well be some sort of a board game. Likewise, throwing a pair of dice might produce equally relevant Judgment for all we know. Or, ripping the heart of a prisoner of war to tell fortunes on it, for that matter.

Therefore the tradition has it bound to the interpretation by the Priesthood. This Cradle Priest must have served at least thirty consecutive years of his civic duty -- a timeframe long enough to acquire some sense of self-preservation along with certain degree of flexibility in his interpretations as not to incur too much wrath and disappointment from either common people or powers that be.

My original plan did not foresee the battle mage in the party at all. I should have just challenged the Hero to a hand-to-hand duel, invoking ever more ancient rite of trial by combat, agreeing to not use any magic in the encounter. To a complete outsider the chances of eighty-something old greyhaired crook whose joints barely held together against much younger, stronger and motivated Hero at his peak physical cababilities were predetermined. But this was where the audience will be gravely surprised. In our world an individual seriously involved in warfare and power struggles will rarely live up to such an advanced age if he did not pack something surprising up his sleeve. Figuratively speaking. Especially figuratively speaking.

But then they somehow convinced the Priest to join the party. At first I thought it will be just another minor nuisance to deal with. But the more I considered the situation the more I realized how many of a much greater opportunities this sudden change presented for me. The Priest could and should provide the very legitimacy with which my master plan will be cemented. And the first cornerstone of that legitimacy is about to appear from the blood chalice. A whole lot of future efforts now depended on how much experience the Priest had acquired during his service and whether or not he caught enough glimpses of my plan to play along with it.

\section{Up To Interpretation}

The Priest stopped murmuring abruptly, the chalice trembled and with a loud cracking sound a bright column of flickering blue sparks fired from it to the ceiling, hung there for a few moments and crashed back into chalice. In a few seconds another cracking sound and another column of sparks bursted up, this time bright white and began slowly drifting towards Ferin, fading one by one as they touched him. We all sat in silence, waiting, but the chalice did not indicate any more signs of activity.

\say{The All Gods rule in favor of Ferin, son of Enceris,} said the Priest. Now it was my turn to accumulate all my willpower and put it into the most stone face of all stone faces that have ever stone faced. \say{The White Mark ascertains the purity of his heart, honesty and clarity of his intentions, weight and trueness of his accusations,} continued the Priest, \say{and the All Gods shall deliver the justice as follows. The All Gods rule against the Lugen, son of Adaxos and find him guilty as charged. The Blue Mark ascertains the malice of his heart, fallacious nature of his intentions, futility and failure of his defense.} Besides the very fact of my defeat, all of this fancy wording was just a formality. The important and hardest part comes right now, when the Priest should interpret the very vague and symbolic "verdict" of All Gods in a very specific action of punishment. For a brief moment, I wished they brought someone with the rank of at least Temple Priest.

Meanwhile, the Priest continued, \say{\dots the All Gods shall deliver the justice as follows. The blue shade of the Mark signifies heavens in the blue sky as the position of power above all earthly matters and dwellers. The abrupt crash of a heaven signifies relinquishment of the said power. The All Gods rule that Lugen, son of Adaxos, must step down.}

Tick-tock, clank-clank. Oh, these precious moments of my life like seeing something I carefully crafted finally come to fruition. The quartet looked at me in horror. I relieved my stone face from duty and just sat there for a few seconds, looking absent-minded, reminding myself that I should not, at any cost whatsoever, turn this tragedy into a farce.

\say{What?} I asked them, \say{why are you looking at me like that? Oh, I am so sorry, Ferin, but I am not planning to die anytime soon. Should you decide to press this matter, I would not be so compliant, just for your information. But other than that, isn't it what you all were hoping for? I gave you my word. The despot is deposed. The tyranny is lifted. The oppressed cheer in joy,} I almost said "and they happily lived ever after", but this was a bit premature, and, honestly, I did not want to jinx on that, \say{You have got what you wanted, haven't you, idiots?}

I stood and turned on my "business-boring" voice. \say{It is quite late in the night, by the way. Given the newly discovered circumstances I kindly ask you all to stay at these grounds as my honoured guests until, at least, tomorrow morning. Please, use the exact way you entered here to return back to the Inner Court of the Citadel, where my castellan will greet you and provide you with living quarters, medical assistance if needed, food, drink, hot bath and whatever else you might reasonably need at this time of night. As a gesture of my good will, your weapons or whatever remained of them will not be forfeit. But I strongly discourage you from any attempts to refuse my hospitality at least until the sunrise. Have a good night, and excuse me -- I have plenty of work to do,} I waved my hand and the entrance door slammed open. The warband, throwing concerning glances towards me, retreated. On the edge of my perception, I overheard the archer say \say{If this is some perverted form of execution, I\dots}, slapping sound and Ferin's angry \say{shut up}.

Of course, I could not have resisted the temptation of a little farewell practical joke. The castellan was ordered to provide archer and the Priest each with regular single-bed room, but a luxurious double-bed honeymoon-styled apartment for Alice and Ferin. For a brief moment I considered ordering a ceiling mirror installed above their bed but then decided it will be just too much. Alice was not kind of a girl easily pushed and might ruin the intended outcome just because she felt being contrary.

I looked down on my table, where the large sheet of paper rested, empty. I took a stylo and wrote "The Decree".

\royaldecree{I, Lugen XII, by the will of All Gods steward of these united blessed lands and protector of their peoples, do hereby declare the following:\dots}
