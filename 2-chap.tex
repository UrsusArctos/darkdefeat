\section{Life Of A Dream}

Alice yawned and stretched under the blanket of enormous size but decidedly did not want to open her eyes, let alone rise from the too soft bed. It has been months since she had an opportunity to sleep on anything but rough straw-filled mattresses or, sometimes, her own cloak laid on bare ground.

Ferin was still sleeping on a couch across the room. Alice did not want to be too accessible too soon, his interest and advances towards her needed some warming up and proof of persistence. She would not throw herself in the hands of any would-be Prince from distant postwar hellhole kingdom, abundant with nothing but enormous nationalist pride. After all, she was of royal descent, too.

There was a careful knock on the door. Alice opened her eyes, quickly reached under the pillow and grabbed a dagger. One can never be too safe.

\say{Come in,} she said.

The door opened and two busy-looking past-average aged women entered, stood at the foot of Alice's bed and bowed deeply. Their clothing was richly sewn with gold threads and they both wore silver medallions with Lugen's family crest embossed on them.

\say{Good morning, my Lady,} they said synchronously. Then one to the right continued, \say{I am Bertha, the head of your Administration Chamber and this is Ursula, the Housekeeper of the Citadel. We\dots er\dots did not really wanted to interrupt your rest but there are several very pressing bureaucratic matters not addressed in the decree of your predecessor,} she reached in her pocket and produced a notebook and a stylus. \say{Namely, the issuance of royal assents and dissents to public petitioners as well as many other document workflows in the Administration Chamber have been suspended pending approval of your royal formal and informal title, styling, address and formal name, possible alterations to the royal stamp and motto if needed, et cetera.}

\say{My Lady, Inauguration planning session should also be scheduled as soon as possible,} intervened Ursula, \say{so we need firsthand update on the current political situation, that is, as of this moment, whether the Nation of Ezeek is considered by the throne as hostile, neutral or friendly, as well as the political status of its heir apparent}, both women synchronously glanced towards still sleeping Ferin and Ursula continued, \say{whether there will be a royal wedding ceremony coincident with inaugural or a separate one}.

\say{If I may be of help, my Lady,} intervened Bertha, \say{I may suggest some options to restart and expedite the governance process. Since the foundation of your dynasty there were six reigning Alices so according to tradition your formal name may be Alice VII. Of six reigning Alices four were styled as Queens, one as Empress and one as Grand Duchess. Speaking of titles, if you were to continue the tradition laid down by your predecessor, it would be Dark Overlady as informal title, and "by the will of All Gods stewardess of these united blessed lands and protectress of their peoples" as formal title; finally an address style has to be approved both for formal correspondence and for addressing by your subjects and guests, you may go as "Your Majesty", "Your Grace" or any qualifier of your choice. Please, my Lady.}

Alice sat on the bed hugging her knees and staring at both women with eyes wide open. For a second time in less than a day, the inflow of information completely overwhelmed her consciousness.

\say{Wha\dots What???} she squeaked, \say{my what?! Predecessor? Chamber? Wedding?! Inauguration?! What the hell happened here?! Explain away!}

\say{Of course, my Lady,} bowed Bertha, \say{by the decree of Lord Lugen XII, by the will of All Gods steward of these united blessed lands and protector of their peoples, he relinquished the throne and stepped down from all positions of power within said blessed lands, thereby declaring the Inheritance effective immediately, that is, about five hours earlier. Since you are the only known heir of Lord Lugen, you have now assumed almost all the aforementioned positions except the chair at the Council of High Magisters which will remain vacant for the time being. Your positions are: Lady Alice VII by the will of All Gods stewardess of these united blessed lands and protectress of their peoples, supreme Lady commander of the Dark Legions, Grand Admiral of the Dark Fleet, Lady protector of the Faith and Overseer of the Temples, the President Benefactor of the Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Chairman of the Council of Guild Masters, and a number of lesser positions most of which are honorary and require little to no attention. By now, my Lady, the whole peoples to the farthest extent of the blessed lands are aware and eager to pray for and congratulate your\dots err\dots Majesty Queen Alice VII on your ascension and wish you the long and prosperous reign.

My Lady, what is with the names and titles? I need to restart the governance or by evening the Citadel will be buried under the paperwork.}

\say{Go with the defaults}, replied Alice, \say{bring us some breakfast. And find me an office well lit with good view around and with a soft and comfortable leather chair. The very thought of sitting on that ugly chunk of metal makes me cold.}

\say{At once, my Lady. Anything else?}

\say{Yes,} Alice seemed to have regained her confidence completely, pointed at still sleeping Ferin and asked \say{how many people in the administration know who he is?}

\say{Only us, Your Majesty.}

Alice rose from the bed and looked at them attentively, then asked \say{Keep it that way, then. But how did you know that?}

\say{We have received specific instructions from Lord Lugen in a letters accompanying the Decree,} said Ursula.

\say{I want to see them,} said Alice.

\say{Unfortunately, Your Majesty, it is not going to be possible. The letters bore a Seal of Nondisclosure and burned away once we read them.}

\say{Of course\dots All right, that is it. I expect a breakfast in ten minutes,} said Alice and went to the shower room as both women departed, bowing.

\section{Identity Crisis}

When Alice entered the bedroom again, Ferin sat on his couch with rather confused look on his face, observing considerable variety of dishes on a golden plates and golden utensils on table right in front of him. Alice took a chair, sat behind the table, took the utensils and looked inquiringly at him, saying \say{What's wrong? You better eat all of it, we have a lot of work today.}

\say{Good morning. What did I miss?} asked Ferin looking at the gold, \say{This level of luxury can't possibly be extended for a guest-prisoners, am I right?}

\say{Oh, you missed a lot. First of all, for a supposedly stereotypically romantic knight-like character you like to portray yourself to be, who swears his absolute loyalty to me and professes his undying eternal love each time you want to have sex with me, you missed at least two unexpected and unannounced intruders who might have been assassins. So much so for, to quote, "ever watchfully by your side", you sleeping beauty,} Alice took her time to chew on food, watching Ferin's face reddening in ever more confusion.

\say{Other news,} Alice continued, \say{I am now Her Majesty Queen Alice VII, Dark Overlady, by the will of All Gods stewardess of\dots err\dots shit\dots I have got to memorize this. Anyway, from now on, I am the rightful supreme ruler of the Dark Domain, Dark Legions, Dark Fleet, this Citadel and pretty much everything that is around, including number of other fancy things and entities whose names I also have got to memorize, I guess.

And no, this is not a joke. I would not be joking about that since I find this absolutely not funny at all.}

They kept eating for a few minutes in silence, building tension, then Alice finally said. \say{All right, what is it? You do not seem to have been particularly impressed or surprised by this big news.}

\say{Why should I?} asked Ferin, his voice unusually quiet, \say{Lugen lost the Judgement, promised to step down, kept his word and acted accordingly. You are his only known heir and within full legal rights and capabilities to inherit the throne. It is only logical.}

\say{You are happy for me, aren't you, Ferin?}

\say{I am. Congratulations on your ascension, by the way. Long live the Queen,} said Ferin with the voice more appropriate for delivering an eulogy.

Alice pushed the golden plate away, turned towards Ferin and banged her hand against the table, saying \say{Enough of this shit! You will never have me in your bed unless you stop pretending to be little fragile girl easily hurt by the innate injustices of this world and a snail which would rather cower than speak your mind openly! I now have an entire domain to babysit and I expect a tangible \textit{support} from you, not having to babysit you as well!}

Ferin turned towards Alice too and covered her hand with his palm. He looked bemused, his eyes were very sad as he looked at her.

\say{Support? And what kind of support would that be, exactly? Alice,} he said, \say{Do you remember how it all began, all these years ago? How did \textit{we} began? Do you even remember what we were trying to achieve back then?

I do remember. Before I met you, I felt incomplete, partial. And it is not about my feelings towards you. It is about my ambitions, the very definition of what I am as a person in this world, what I am able to prove myself capable of doing, my ultimate reponsibility for making at least some part of this world a bit better than it was.

And in the very rare occasions when you seem to speak your mind honestly and openly, I saw it in you that you felt exactly the same. That there is some drive inside you to prove your worthiness to the world, to your father, to anyone who dares doubting you, that you are someone to be reckoned with.

In these moments I felt like we complete each other, we are two missing pieces of the puzzle of this world, who together make up more than one obscure corner but rather complete the entire picture with some important new quality.

Now, where did it all go?}

\say{Did it go?} asked Alice caringly.

\say{Did you hear what your father said yesterday before I decided to partake in the Judgement of All Gods?

He said, basically, that I was nothing, an empty space, no one believed in me, no one knew I exists, no one supports me, no one cares if I achieve anything or not, that I am now the distant remnant of the once glorious family now forever forgotten! A complete and utter failure! And it all was true, every word of it, he immediately saw right through my pathetic deception! And he did not even use magic for that, all it took is a bit of observation, logical analysis and a piece of Ezeek newspaper on politics.}

\say{Whoa, whoa, stop right there, boy,} said Alice raising her palms in denial. \say{First of all, I do not remember him saying these exact words. He just voiced some concerns about your credibility as a potential player in the political landscape of Ezeek. Your chances there as you stand today are ineed minuscule, but that is no secret and it had never concerned you this much before. What happened now?

Secondly, come on, Ferin. Do not take his words too literally. You would not expect him to praise and glorify someone who just minutes ago burst into his throne chamber with apparent intent to kill him. Such level of cynicism is beyond even my father. He had to punish you for it, if only by such humiliation. All circumstances considered, you ended up very lucky through this ordeal. By lucky, I mean alive and in a single piece. Cheer up.}

\section{Second Revelation}

\say{I don't know, Alice. Your words make sense as much as his words do and that confuses me even more. I am totally gullible and totally lost.

And look at you. I remember very well what you said back then when we decided to go together. That he raised you more as a heir to the throne and less as his beloved daughter. That your mother was the only source of any warm feelings, love and care a family must be cemented with. And that when she departed to the better worlds you ran away because of exactly that -- you could not anymore stand being treated as an instrument of function rather than dear and close soul.

So what changed since then? Oh, he handed you his power on a plate. Decided that you are finally ready after all these years he spent schooling you to be his successor ruler. Made sure the complex clockwork of Dark Domain is greased to the specs and is in a competent hands.}

Alice very gently touched his lips with her fingers and said in a soft quiet voice \say{Ferin, please don't say that. It is not true, and it is more complex than you think. I had some conversation with father yesterday before you had the Judgement of All Gods commenced. He is much more human than I previously thought. And a very tired one. My running away actually made him suffer and I am feeling guilty over it.}

\say{This is called a manipulation, my dear Alice -- imposition of guilt on someone to make them help achieve one's own ulterior goals. Parents are prone of it just as well as the others. And I already see, from the way you look and talk, that you took this bait seriously, that you plan on ruling the Dark Domain thoroughly and already mentally sorting the order of envoys and ambassadors you shall meet today in the most politically effective order.}

\say{What is your problem with that, Ferin? Would you rather me refuse? Ding-dong, fresh news -- I did not have a choice! He was within his right to decide on it personally and unilaterally, he wrote an Inheritance Decree this night and I woke up today's morning already a Queen Alice VII and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it. And you know what? By law, I can not abdicate the throne until I produce a heir of my own!}

They suddenly stopped, glanced at each other embarrassedly, Alice blushed and Ferin abruptly leaned forward. Their eyes closed, lips touched and for a few long seconds nothing else mattered in the slightest.

Then Alice gently pushed Ferin away, and smiled, saying \say{Don't get too used to it, lovebird.}

Ferin blinked for a few seconds as if restoring his grasp to reality and said \say{What I wanted to say, Alice, is that I believe we both lost our way. The way we envisioned together when we started it years ago. Up until today we supported each other because we could not walk the way we chose and achieve our ambitions without each other's support and encouragement. To an extent we were a role models for each other. And now what? This much power and responsibility handed to you overnight means, first and foremost, that you will no longer find any time whatsoever to be yourself, not Dark Overlady. You do not need my support anymore since there is full Dark Domain at your personal disposal, and I can not rely on yours because your position essentially depersonalize you and I am bound to be on the bottom list of your priorities, no matter our personal affections.

Your father was right. It is over, Alice. This is the end.}

Alice leaned back on the chair and thought deeply. First, never before she witnessed Ferin in a depressive mood of such magnitude under the least stressing circumstances. Second, never once either of them had ruled out her eventual ascension to power, including, but not limited to, as an instrument to achieve own goals. Why would this all of a sudden pose a problem, and what kind of a problem exactly -- Alice did not understand. Third, judging by the arguments he just invoked about not needing a support and his priorities being not on top of everything else\dots What an asshole. "This is called a manipulation -- imposition of guilt on someone to make them help achieve one's own ulterior goals?" Exactly what is happening here. Ferin is being jealous and manipulative jerk, fearing that the world, represented by Alice, would stop revolving around his dearest enormous ego any time he felt like it.

But, apparently, there is more to it than that. His concerns were at least partially genuine. His strangely misplaced reference and sheer emotional overreaction to Lugen's yesterday humiliating speech about his future political career in Ezeek is definitely suspicious and could indicate Ferin did not tell her everything there is to know about it. How she could help him achieve that goal is unclear, unless\dots Unless\dots Unless seven years ago the Dark Lord launched a successful military campaign against the Nation of Ezeek and through means less than humane in general, bent the circumstances to his will.

Alice tasted the idea of starting another devastating war just to have one pretty handsome but very manipulative jerk to feel needed, valued and appreciated. The idea tasted bad. Let's rethink it from there. A full scale offensive is not needed, per se. We will not be facing combined Inilpan and Ezeek forces this time, even though the last time it was a ruse on behalf of Inilpan rulers.

One Dark Legion at most will be sufficient to deter any tribe warlord, if needed and to demonstrate the seriousness of Overlady's intentions and demands. Now what could those be? Install Ferin, son of Enceris as Sceptre wielder? They would behead him as a traitor and collaborator as soon as Dark Overlady returns home. And she could not stay at Ezeek because\dots Because why? Because that would be a standing occupational force and every merry bonus that comes with it like sabotage and guerilla warfare.

No, it would not work at all. Any enforcement would not work at all. At least, in the long run. But, what her father had said yesterday? "Bring them the head of their mortal enemy, bring them \textit{freedom} from oppression and let them believe that this was the true source of their suffering and it is no more, and the common folk will unconditionally hand you the Sceptre overnight", he said. Bring them the head of their mortal enemy, huh? That would be me, thought Alice. Check. Bring them freedom from oppression. But wait, I'm not oppressing them yet. Check. And let them believe it is no more? Like how? Uncheck. All right, it was Lugen, not me, who oppressed them, that one they will understand. But I can not possibly credibly demonstrate to Ezeek that "Lugen is no more", let alone his head as "head of their mortal enemy". That is just beyond impossible. Unless\dots What did Ferin just say? "your position essentially depersonalize you", he said. Depersonalize. Alice tasted the word. Meaning, the job dissolves your own identity making you as yourself indistinguishable from your position. Can this be a solution? Solution. Ha-ha, pun intended. Bring them the head of their mortal enemy. Not the actual Dark Overlord or Dark Overlady in person, but their dissolved, depersonalized selves. And make it big enough they choke on it. 

The Dark Domain itself. That was it. Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. The idea struck her like a lightning. This will work.

\section{Necessary Micromanagement}

There were just a few technicalities to be solved, and first technicality sat right in front of her in a deep depression and almost crying over his self-perceived uselessness. All right, it seems an appropriate time for some domestic violence. 

Alice stood up and said in her most menacing and threatening voice, \say{You will owe me forever and dearly for what I am about to do for you, but only this time,} she swung her arm and landed a heavy slap on Ferin's back of the head, \say{Listen up, asshole! Next time you try to cry me a river over your inability to find purpose in life or failing to achieve it, I will just agree and kick your sorry ass out!} yelled Alice, landing another slap on Ferin's head, \say{Now shut up, suit up, and follow my every order unconditionally, which you actually must do within my domain anyway!}

Eyes wide open but not saying a single word, Ferin quickly dressed up and stood in front of her, looking down.

\say{Wait outside, I will be in a moment,} said Alice and he left. Dressing up, Alice vividly remembered how her father once shared a piece of his wisdom she did not understand at the time, saying \say{"Freedom and adulthood are similar in that they both are \textit{not} an ability to do what you want. Freedom and adulthood are different in that true freedom is a right to not do what you do not want, while adulthood is an obligation to do what you must towards those who do not yet (or already) possess either quality.}

Alice went outside and looked around, expecting\dots Aha, there he is. \say{You are to show me into my office, am I right?}

\say{Yes, Your Majesty}, said young servant, \say{Please, follow me.}

They crossed the square inside the Inner Court. Ferin gasped in surprise, looking at the brand new, polished and shiny entrance door to the Inner Court, looked as if they did not blew the previous one to slivers just a night earlier. Nothing indicated the attack ever took place. Ferin wondered how many people today actually knew that it took place.

To a mild surprise of Alice, they did not enter the sanctum. A minute later, ascending stairway of snow-colored marble, Alice finally verbalized what seemed wrong with the situation around them.

\say{Where is everyone?} she inquired, \say{I remember the Courts to be rather crowdy places but now I have only seen like five guards in a hidden niches and a two or three page-boys carrying something.}

\say{There actually are not many people in the Citadel, Your Majesty,} replied the servant, \say{They are mainly employed in the Administration Chamber and in keepers house, but that is on the other side. During the regular workdays, such as today, most of them do not need to go about Citadel grounds since the Lord Lugen decided it causes a huge waste of time. Rather every employee is provided with a necessary number of servants at his disposal.}

Finally they entered the room, and every aspect of it looked absolutely opposite that of the Lugen's throne chamber. Gigantic windows, dazzling blue and white marble decorations, grape vines hanging from the special ceiling hooks and tethers, and in a corner, a fountain. With golden fish.

A long table and a two dozen chairs stood in the middle of the room and at the far end the table was crowned with massive leather chair with elaborate decorations and a family crest.

\say{This could not have been built overnight,} mused Alice, \say{therefore there has to be a reason for the Dark Citadel of the Dark Overlord to have this little girl's playground.} She walked down the table, sat in the chair and declared, \say{This is perfect}.

\say{You,} she said to the servant, \say{I will see Ursula, then Chief of General Staff, preferably with some maps of northwestern territories, then Ambassador of Nation of Ezeek, and then whoever is in charge of Royal Protocol. And you,} Alice pointed to Ferin, \say{wait outside until I am done talking to Ursula.}

The Housekeeper of the Citadel showed up in almost no time, bowed and said, \say{Your Majesty?}

\say{Take a seat,} Alice pointed at the closest chair, \say{Tell me, how important is the Inauguration politically?}

\say{Not particularly, my Lady. Traditionally, only the rulers who were not confident enough in their right to the throne or did not gain enough popular support sought to stage a show of power and wealth with elaborate details and rituals. It is still prescribed in the Keeper codex as a part of formal enactment of the ascension, but, legally speaking, the Inheritance Decree is much stronger legislation. Actually, the last time a full-scale Inauguration was staged by your grand-grand-father, Lord Odonis.}

\say{How much did it cost then?} asked Alice.

\say{Accounting for inflation, today it would be about a four hundred thousand crowns.}

Holy shit, thought Alice. This was nearly unimaginable amount of money. For four to five crowns a day one could afford a decent breakfast, dinner and supper, pay for a room in a good hotel and there will still be a change left for some souvenirs.

\say{This is not that much as it sounds,} observed Ursula, \say{especially in comparison to the other budgetary spending like military or urban development.}

\say{All right, how about this. No inaugural show. To celebrate the ascension of their modest and beloved Queen, Her Majesty decided to issue an one-time royal gift of a comparable amount of crowns distributed evenly among the city populace, per person. Have it ready for the next round of montly taxation.}

\say{Excellent idea, my Lady.}

\say{Now, did you receive any special instructions concerning my\dots ahem\dots \textit{other} associates?}

\say{Yes, my Lady. They were given some amount of money, strong suggestion to avoid any further association like this lest they are tired of their own heads upon their shoulders, and set free, per Lord Lugen's order.}

The old man is indeed getting soft, mentally noticed Alice. Is he still haunted by the past this much?

\say{Where is he now, by the way?} inquired Alice.

\say{No one knows,} replied Ursula, \say{no one has seen him since tonight's events. And I have a feeling he would not reappear in the Citadel anytime soon, my Lady.}

\say{And one last thing Ursula, since you asked this before\dots There will likely be a royal wedding. It is just not yet clear when, and I am talking of months, probably year. It is not to be announced yet, of course, but I wanted to give some advance notice to you to avoid surprises in the future.}

\say{I understand, my Lady.}

\say{That is it for now, Ursula. Have a good day.}
