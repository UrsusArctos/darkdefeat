\section{Life Of A Dream}

Alice yawned and stretched under the blanket of enormous size but decidedly did not want to open her eyes, let alone rise from the too soft bed. It has been months since she had an opportunity to sleep on anything but rough straw-filled mattresses or, sometimes, her own cloak laid on bare ground.

Ferin was still sleeping on a couch across the room. Alice did not want to be too accessible too soon, his interest and advances towards her needed some warming up and proof of persistence. She would not throw herself in the hands of any would-be Prince from distant postwar hellhole kingdom, abundant with nothing but enormous nationalist pride. After all, she was of royal descent, too.

There was a careful knock on the door. Alice opened her eyes, quickly reached under the pillow and grabbed a dagger. One can never be too safe.

\say{Come in,} she said.

The door opened and two busy-looking past-average aged women entered, stood at the foot of Alice's bed and bowed deeply. Their clothing was richly sewn with gold threads and they both wore silver medallions with Lugen's family crest embossed on them.

\say{Good morning, my Lady,} they said synchronously. Then one to the right continued, \say{I am Bertha, the head of your Administration Chamber and this is Ursula, the Housekeeper of the Citadel. We\dots er\dots did not really wanted to interrupt your rest but there are several very pressing bureaucratic matters not addressed in the decree of your predecessor,} she reached in her pocket and produced a notebook and a stylus. \say{Namely, the issuance of royal assents and dissents to public petitioners as well as many other document workflows in the Administration Chamber have been suspended pending approval of your royal formal and informal title, styling, address and formal name, possible alterations to the royal stamp and motto if needed, et cetera.}

\say{My Lady, Inauguration planning session should also be scheduled as soon as possible,} intervened Ursula, \say{so we need firsthand update on the current political situation, that is, as of this moment, whether the Nation of Ezeek is considered by the throne as hostile, neutral or friendly, as well as the political status of its heir apparent}, both women synchronously glanced towards still sleeping Ferin and Ursula continued, \say{whether there will be a royal wedding ceremony coincident with inaugural or a separate one}.

\say{If I may be of help, my Lady,} intervened Bertha, \say{I may suggest some options to restart and expedite the governance process. Since the foundation of your dynasty there were six reigning Alices so according to tradition your formal name may be Alice VII. Of six reigning Alices four were styled as Queens, one as Empress and one as Grand Duchess. Speaking of titles, if you were to continue the tradition laid down by your predecessor, it would be Dark Overlady as informal title, and "by the will of All Gods stewardess of these united blessed lands and protectress of their peoples" as formal title; finally an address style has to be approved both for formal correspondence and for addressing by your subjects and guests, you may go as "Your Majesty", "Your Grace" or any qualifier of your choice. Please, my Lady.}

Alice sat on the bed hugging her knees and staring at both women with eyes wide open. For a second time in less than a day, the inflow of information completely overwhelmed her consciousness.

\say{Wha\dots What???} she squeaked.
