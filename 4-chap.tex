\section{Expectations and Allegiances}

Her Majesty Queen Alice VII sat in her enormous chair, legs on the table, staring blankly at the ornamented ceiling. Today it was the last place in the whole Citadel she would rather be. The first one being, of course, the top of the Oceanwatch tower, from where any approaching sails were visible first.

When the news of the Kalpan mission disaster were first briefly reported through the signaling towers from Darbash, Ambassador Tam immediately sought her audience. The audience was granted and lasted exactly fifteen seconds during which Her Majesty barely holding back her rage and in the voice that could freeze the sunlight ordered the Ambassador to collect as much information about the incident as possible and wait to be invited to give an explanation when all of the Ezeek mission members return home safely. Without being permitted to say a word, the Ambassador was then dismissed.

Depending on the prevailing winds, it would take three to five days for the ships to return. So Alice forced herself to conduct some government duties in the meanwhile. Two secretaries from the Administration Chamber sat opposite each other at the table and read the selected cases that required her attention.

\say{Petition for royal pardon,} announced one secretary while the other shuffled papers, \say{Kor Imlan, twenty-nine, decorated war veteran, killed two in a drunken bar fight, sentenced ten, served five, repentant, excellent behavior.}

\say{Granted,} murmured Alice.

\say{Complaint,} announced the other secretary, \say{Fishermen Guild of Port Rayton, too high local sales tax enforced by the municipality, citing ten percent above average, also granted the Temple permanent buy-out privilege for half a market price. Thirty percent fishing companies went bankrupt since the season begins, all sold allegedly to magistrate associates.}

\say{Refer to the Dark Eye, possible conspiracy between municipality and the Temple Priest, corruption charges, indecent market practices, probably monopolization.

Also, written commentary tomorrow from Bertha on why the hell does that shit needs to go all the way trhough me. Aren't there local Dark Eye office in Port Rayton?}

\say{Your Majesty, the Dark Eye personnel traditionally does not allow any official contacts with commoners if not undercover. Or anyone, for that matter. They are considered as\dots at your \textit{personal} disposal, not answerable to anyone else but the reigning monarch.}

\say{All right, I will see to it. Carry on.}

\say{Petition from Ezeek diaspora in Port Dauruna,} continued secretary and Alice shuddered, \say{Permission to build a monument to Uluna of the Enceris Dynasty, locally popular as\dots}

\say{I know who she was. What is the problem?}

\say{Municipality and Temple Priest are against installing it on the central square, arguing the diaspora has its own large city district.}

\say{Overruled, granted,} said Alice.

\say{Invitation from the Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences. Tricentennial anniversary of its foundation. Annual committee on Grants and Awards for gifted youngsters.}

\say{No, not this time.}

There was a knock in the door and the servant peered in, saying \say{Your Majesty, sails on approach from northwest, matching the "Dexterous".}

Alice nodded and dismissed both secretaries, saying \say{I will see the Special Envoy immediately.}

Unbearable minutes floated by. Door opened and Ferin stepped in with guilty look on his face. Alice stood and took a step towards him, thinking \say{don't run, don't run!} and ran. She crashed into him, hung on him, hugged him, punched him in the chest with her little fists, then hugged him again, all while crying and trying to say everything important at the same time.

At first second Ferin was in complete shock and did not know what to do but then his mating instincts finally kicked in to a full throttle. He hugged Alice, gently stroking and kissing her head and cheeks while wiping her endless waterfall of tears with his handkerchief and listening to horrible sobbing threats of curses she would inflict upon him should he "ever do that to her again". After a while, waterfall of tears mostly ceased, they sat quietly on a coach still hugging. They both did not know what to say but it seemed the words were not necessary.

Finally, Alice sobered up, regained self-confidence, stood and walked to her presiding chair, saying \say{Come on, Your Excellence, we have work to do.}

The Director of the Dark Eye, as is expected from the head of the secret police, was an average man with average face bearing no distinctive features whatsoever. Take your look away from him and you would not remember him at all.

\say{Director, please, begin with casualty report,} said Alice.

\say{Your Majesty,} replied Director, \say{of seventeen people assigned to the mission, four agents who were parts of a decoys, are alive and out of danger. Ten are confirmed dead as a result of an attack. Three more agents and the Lieutenant Niorn with four of his men are thought to have escaped the hotel but we are yet to contact and confirm their status. This makes the total number of casualties nineteen -- ten of ours and nine legionnaires.}

\say{Carry on,} encouraged Alice.

\say{The identity of the attackers can not yet be ascertained with enough degree of confidence. What we surely know is that they were not tribal raiders nor a municipal guardsmen nor an Ezeek armed forces. The working hypothesis is that it was either one of the criminal clan enforcers or some kind of private security team owned by the Dynastic Council or by some subgroup within it.

The attackers used two large carriages to block either entrance to the hotel, then a group of about thirty men stormed it through the balconies on the second floor. The second group of about ten attackers entered the fifth floor through the roof from neighboring buildings -- this was the group encountered by Lieutenant Niorn and his men when they, apparently, decided to escape the hotel via the roof. That second group is likely to have been destroyed although we are yet to hear any reports from Niorn or any of the men in his company. It should be noted that by now they already missed several deadlines and opportunities to make contact with our agents in Kalpan, which may indicate that they have been captured by the Council. Also, it is generally slow process since the closest signaling stations not under control of the Council are in Xubash which is several days ride from Kalpan. Even if they alive and free, we may not know it until much after, for example, if they decided to make it to Xubash rather than risk contacting and explosing the local ring.

The whole attack lasted eight minutes, and then the Wildfyre charge was detonated inside, per contingency plan. The hotel and two neighboring buildings burned out completely, and only the attackers who were outside at the moment of explosion, survived.}

\say{Official reactions? Rumors? Media coverage?} inquired Alice.

\say{Surprisingly scarce. The fire was reported as residential accident, no mention of any the attack on the diplomatic mission. So far the Dynastic Council has issued no relevant statements whatsoever. About the rumors,} Director hesitated, \say{Your Majesty, Ezeek people are far less curious and more busy with themselves than one might think. They are unlikely to spread rumors about the events that does not concern them personally or imminently. Such is their mentality.}

Alice once again put her legs on a table and considered the ornamented ceiling. She had hoped to reach some conclusion without involving Ambassador Tam but the general situation looked like they will need an insider information anyway. And, perhaps, once again base their analysis and decisions on the information provided by a man whose incentives had already cost Her Majesty many lives of her loyal subjects and whose good faith and peacemaking intentions remained dubious at best.

Alice rang a bell and called for Ambassador Tam.

\say{Meanwhile,} she said to Director of the Dark Eye, \say{Summarily, it looks like we know next to nothing for sure besides the basic timeline of events. And the spy ring in Kalpan is quote extensive, I take it? What do they do, I wonder?}

\say{Your Majesty,} replied the Director with light undertones of tiredness in his voice, \say{our persistently major problem with Kalpan and Ezeek in general is that most of our agents there are commoners. This is why our mission was so luckily forewarned -- someone closer to the circles of, say, private security services or "thugs-for-hire" as they are known locally, overheard certain calls and exchanges mentioning certain places and personalities with payouts promised being atypically higher than normal.

You see, in the Dark Domain the upwards social mobility exists such that, in theory, any peasant can reach almost any administrative position in the government solely on his or her merits and skills. But in the Nation of Ezeek the strategic decisions are made by nobles only. And it is extremely hard to infiltrate the Ezeek nobility due to the central role of dynasties in ther life.

A complete outsider with impenetrable legend can only join the dynasty as a family member, i.e. via marriage or adoption. But that does not grant them any of the dynastic privileges. They can not even style themselves as inlaws of dynastic head or Prince; they can participate in the tribal assembly but have no vote rights there. Only their children born in the union with the member of the Dynasty are considered full members with all the eligibilities this entails, but even then, line of Princely succession can be altered in favor of the younger heir if his bloodline joined the dynasty earlier than that of the older one.

Similarly it is hard to recruit an agent from a native nobility, for the same reason. Their loyalties to their Dynasties far exceed even their loyalty towards the Sceptre. The wielder of the Sceptre is not an absolute monarch but rather an "agreed upon" figure equally tolerable by all Princes, even though he has tangible authority over them. It takes an extraordinary circumstances for a member of the Dynasty, even not currently one with the elected Prince, to shift his or her loyalty elsewhere, risk expulsion and accept our offer even of being just an information source, not to mention more active roles.}

\say{Uh-huh,} said Alice, \say{So, let me guess, of thirteen dynasties who were at the Council that day, we have informants in\dots none of them?}

\say{Unfortunately, Your Majesty, this is correct. You should understand that in the pre-war period we mostly focused on the Princely dynasties who are now extinct except that of His Excellency Special Envoy,} respectful nod towards Ferin. \say{But the power structure of Ezeek since then, embodied by the Dynastic Council is far less transparent than before. We really know very little of it.}
