\section{Expectations and Allegiances}

Her Majesty Queen Alice VII sat in her enormous chair, feet on table, staring blankly to the ornamented ceiling. Today it was the last place in the whole Citadel she would rather be. The first one being, of course, the top of the Oceanwatch tower, from where any approaching sails were visible first.

When the news of the Kalpan mission disaster were first briefly reported through the signaling towers from Darbash, Ambassador Tam immediately sought her audience. The audience was granted and lasted exactly fifteen seconds during which Her Majesty barely holding back her rage and in the voice that could freeze the sunlight ordered the Ambassador to collect as much information about the incident as possible and wait to be invited to give an explanation when all of the Ezeek mission members return home safely. Without being permitted to say a word, the Ambassador was then dismissed.

Depending on the prevailing winds, it would take three to five days for the ships to return. So Alice forced herself to conduct some government duties. Two secretaries from the Administration Chamber sat opposite each other at the table and read the selected cases that required her attention.

\say{Petition for royal pardon,} announced one secretary while the other shuffled papers, \say{Kor Imlan, twenty-nine, decorated war veteran, killed two in a drunken bar fight, sentenced ten, served five, repentant, excellent behavior.}

\say{Granted,} murmured Alice.

\say{Complaint,} announced the other secretary, \say{Fishermen Guild of Port Rayton, too high local sales tax enforced by the municipality, citing ten percent above average, also granted the Temple permanent buy-out privilege for half a market price. Thirty percent fishing companies went bankrupt since the season begins, all allegedly sold to magistrate associates.}

\say{Refer to the Dark Eye, possible conspiracy between municipality and the Temple Priest, corruption charges, indecent market practices, probably monopolization.

Also, written commentary tomorrow from Bertha on why the hell does that shit needs to go all the way trhough me. Aren't there local Dark Eye office in Port Rayton?}

\say{Your Majesty, the Dark Eye personnel traditionally does not allow any official contacts with commoners if not undercover. Or anyone, for that matter. They are considered as\dots at your \textit{personal} disposal, not answerable to anyone else but the reigning monarch.}

\say{All right, I will see to it. Carry on.}

\say{Petition from Ezeek diaspora in Port Dauruna,} continued secretary and Alice shuddered, \say{Permission to build a monument to Uluna of the Enceris Dynasty, locally popular as\dots}

\say{I know who she was. What is the problem?}

\say{Municipality and Temple Priest are against installing it on the central square, arguing the the diaspora has its own large city district.}

\say{Overruled, granted,} said Alice.

\say{Invitation from the Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences. Tricentennial anniversary of its foundation. Annual committee on Grants and Awards for gifted youngsters.}

\say{No, not this time.}

There was a knock in the door and the servant peered in, saying \say{Your Majesty, sails on approach from northwest, matching the "Dexterous".}

Alice nodded and dismissed both secretaries, saying \say{I will see the Special Envoy immediately.}

Unbearable minutes floated by. Door opened and Ferin stepped in with guilty look on his face. Alice stood and took a step towards him, thinking \say{don't run, don't run!} and ran. She crashed into him, hung on him, hugged him, punched him in the chest with her little fists, then hugged him again, all while crying and trying to say everything important at the same time.

At first second Ferin was in complete shock and did not know what to do but then his gender instincts finally kicked in to a full throttle. He hugged Alice, gently stroking and kissing her head and cheeks while wiping her endless waterfall of tears with his handkerchief and listening to horrible sobbing threats of curses she would inflict upon him should he "ever do that to her again". After a while, waterfall of tears mostly ceased
